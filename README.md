BodyCacheRDSplitter
===================
This tool allows you to split BodyCache_RD.bin files to smaller, body_LZ.bin files so you can edit them in Theme Customisation Tools.
BodyCache_RD.bin files can be found on 9.3+ software in Theme ExtData.

How to use this
===================
Use SaveDataFiler to dump your 9.3+ 3DS's Theme ExtData, it's 000002cc, 000002cd or 000002ce depending on your firmware. 
Open your newly created BodyCache_RD.bin from sd:\filer\ExtData\*date*\*ID* in this tool, it should show you the amount of themes in theme shuffler. Press the save button to start saving splitted files.
Now you can open the newly created files in Theme Customiser. ;)
